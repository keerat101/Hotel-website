<h2> Room Type</h2>
<ul>
<li>What's the difference between a Double room and a Twin room?</li>
<P>A double room has one double bed. A twin room has two single beds.</P>
<li>We have two small children; can we get extra beds in the room?
 </li>
 <p>
    In general one extra bed for one child is available at a minor additional charge. However, please note that this possibility depends on each hotel’s policy and availability. We advise you to check the overview page of the hotel, or to send an email to customerservice@bookings.note</p>

<p>
    It will depend on each hotel’s policy and availability. Once you have retrieved the availability for a specific hotel for the requested dates, by clicking on the room name, you will access the room description. If the possibility and the costs of an extra bed in the room are not specified in the room description, please send an e-mail to customerservice@bookings.net.</p>

<h3>Pricing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Are the rates on your website per person or per room?</li>
<p>All rates on the website are per room per stay, unless stated differently.

</p>
<li>Do I pay a reservation fee?</li>
<p>No, we will not charge you a reservation fee.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Credit Cards and Payments</h3>
<ul>
<li>
    Why do you need my credit card details?
    </li>
    <p>In general your credit card details are only required as a guarantee for the hotel in case you don't arrive or cancel too late. This might result in a "no-show" charge (generally the equivalent to one night stay) by the hotel. We will never charge your credit card. You will pay for your stay at the hotel.</p>
    <li>Does the hotel need a deposit or a payment in advance?</li>
    <p>You will pay for your stay at the hotel. If the hotel requires a deposit, it will be clearly mentioned on the overview page of the hotel. However, note that some hotels perform a pre-authorization check on your credit card as an extra guarantee. A pre–authorization is a validity check to reserve a certain amount that would guarantee the room. This amount may correspond to the price of one night or to the total costs of your reservation. Once the credit card has been validated, the reserved amount will be released.

    </p>
<li>What types of credit card can I use to guarantee the reservation?
 </li>
 <p>MasterCard, Visa and American Express are accepted as a guarantee. However, it is possible that the hotel does not accept all of these for payment. Please check at the bottom of the overview page of the hotel the “Hotel Policies” section for ‘Accepted credit cards.’
</p>
<li>Is it safe to fill in my credit card number? How secure is the your website?
</li>
<p>Your credit card information is sent to us through a secure server. We use the latest, most secure technology available, which encrypts all your personal and credit card details. The encryption method used is the industry standard "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL) technology. Our SSL certificate has been issued by Thawte.We also use a firewall which protects our servers and network against unauthorized access. In the unlikely event that your credit card were to be misused, we promise to reimburse you the first 50 Euros on the cost. The credit card is obliged to pay the remainder.
</p>
